School Assignment. Simple Multiplayer game with myPhpAdmin database.

How to setup:
1. Start 3 game instances.
  - Login as server once first (Not required, but it's adviced to do this first).
  - Login as user in the other two instances.
  
  The server instance doesn't require any further user input. You can minimize this window.
  
2. Press Play in both user instances.
3. Done! Very Easy ^^.
